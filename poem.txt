In silent lines the logic flows,
A thought becomes what data knows.
From scattered words to meaning clear,
A pattern forms, a truth appears.

We split the text, we store the thought,
In vectors deep, the answers sought.
A question asked, the past replies,
Old pages wake, new insight flies.

No voice, no face, yet wisdom speaks,
Through chains of code and learning weeks.
In bits and bytes, a mind takes shape,
Turning knowledge into escape.
